1. You are building a 3-class object classification and localization algorithm. The classes are: pedestrian (c=1), car (c=2), motorcycle (c=3). What would be the label for the following image? Recall y = [p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c_1, c_2, c_3]

	[] y = [1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, 0, 1, 0]
	[] y = [1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.3, 0, 1, 0]
	[] y = [1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 1, 0]
	[] y = [1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 0, 0]
	[] y = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 1, 0]
